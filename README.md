## Overview

This project leverages portable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled speakers to create a synchronized sound system across the AGH University campus. By creating a single, coordinated sound network, we aim to amplify campus events and announcements with immersive audio that can be controlled from a central hub.

---

## Objectives

- **Synchronize Portable Speakers**: Establish a network where multiple portable speakers can play audio simultaneously.
- **Central Control**: Enable a centralized controller to manage sound playback across all connected speakers.
- **Campus-Wide Reach**: Design the system to cover as much of the campus as possible, allowing for wide-ranging audio without large-scale installations.

---

## Features

- **Flexible Speaker Connections**: Connects a variety of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled portable speakers.
- **Real-Time Audio Synchronization**: Minimizes latency for synchronized playback across devices.
- **Centralized Control Interface**: Easy-to-use web or app interface for managing audio across the network.
- **Scalable**: Add or remove speakers as needed to adjust the scale of the sound system.

---

## System Requirements

- **Bluetooth and/or Wi-Fi-enabled portable speakers** (compatible with central control software)
- **Central Server or Device** (for managing playback)
- **Campus Wi-Fi Network** (for connecting devices across distances)

### Recommended Specifications

- **Server Requirements**: Minimum of 4GB RAM, dual-core processor for handling multiple connections.
- **Mobile App Compatibility**: iOS and Android for remote control (optional).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Prepare Central Control Device**  
   - Install control software or app on a dedicated device (e.g., laptop or tablet) connected to the campus Wi-Fi.
  
2. **Connect Portable Speakers**  
   - Pair each portable speaker to the central device via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi as available.
   - Verify connection stability for each device.
  
3. **Install Synchronization Software**  
   - Use synchronization software that supports multi-speaker playback.
  
4. **Run Initial Test**  
   - Conduct a test playback session to ensure all speakers are synchronized and functioning correctly.

---

## Usage

1. **Start Playback**  
   - Use the control interface to select and play audio. Adjust volume and settings across all connected speakers.

2. **Adjust Settings**  
   - Volume, playback speed, and device connections can be managed centrally.

3. **Stop and Disconnect**  
   - End playback and safely disconnect all devices when finished.
